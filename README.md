# Bestest Game

A very simple 2D Platformer made using YouTube tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN8CKFlsjPA&list=PL4j7SP4-hFDJXHQUqF6HGzbyCQrLf-wWV
This game was my introduction into Unity game development and allowed me to display some level design abilities!

Get through each level up until the end, the later levels are quite difficult. There is no saving so one playthrough.

# Getting Started

1. Clone the repo: 
  ```bash
  https://github.com/Keladose/First-2D-Platformer.git
  ```
2. These are the completed built files so just simply run the game :)
